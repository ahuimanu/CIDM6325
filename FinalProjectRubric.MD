# Guide to Book Topics for Final Project (Baseline, Good, Better, Best)

I have classified the learning objectives from Antonio's book according to the following scheme.  Each category is relative to the following requirements for your final project:

* You must implement *all* **Baseline** components - Gets you to 70% of the value
* You will implement *at least* six **Good** components - Gets you to 80% of the vaue
* You will implement *at least* two **Better** components - Gets you to 85% of the value
* You will implement *at least* two **Best** components - Gets you to 90% of the value

Where is the remaining 10%? It comes from the synthesis and service to your idea (implementation).

* **Baseline**: Essential Django knowledge that must be demonstrated in your final project
* **Good**: Fundamental knowledge that sets up a more useful app
* **Better**: Approaching a higher degree of robustness
* **Best**: Approaching professional-grade features and tools
