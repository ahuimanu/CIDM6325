## Miscellaneous Notes ##
* **Templates and Bootstrap** - I will strongly recommend that you use and develop familiarity with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a CSS framework for all of your work in this class.
* **Classy Class-Based Views** - Should you wish to go in this direction: [https://ccbv.co.uk/](https://ccbv.co.uk/)
* **Candidate Heroku Replacements** - Heroku used to be the best free Django deployment platform - it is no longer free.  Here are some replacement services.
    * render.io
    * python anywhere
    * Fly.io
    * [Railway](https://railway.app/)
